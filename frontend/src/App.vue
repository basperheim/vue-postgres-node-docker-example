  <!--
  Generally, App.vue serves as the entry point or the "layout" for your application. It's common to have things like
  headers, footers, or navigation components that remain consistent across routes in App.vue. For page-specific content,
  you'd typically place that into individual route components. These components will then be displayed inside the
  <router-view></router-view> based on the current route.
